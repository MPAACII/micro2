---- Generic circuit instructions

Your PIC hardware application should work with Vcc/Vdd = 3.3 Volt (NOT 5 Volt) - (MANDATORY)

Make sure your power supply has a 3.3V output in order to supply your circuit  - (MANDATORY)

Make sure you use(import) the given Lab1_MPLABXproject file to get started with the MPLAB X development environment - (MANDATORY)

It is MANDATORY to use the LabReport_template to compose your own lab report in pdf form AND printed. Template Specs:(Font Size 12, Spacing Size 1, Font Helvetica , Given text boxes, answering all the listed sample questions)





--- How to use an FTDI cable 

Sources: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717
(guides and driver links are included)

Be careful , the provided FTDI cable has 

Vcc = 5V  

The rest of I/O pins are 3.3V tollerant (TXD and RXD )

PWM servo motor consumes around 350mA 



-------- Be careful ------------
If you want to use your FTDI cable to Power your circuit you should make a voltage regulation circuuit to convert the 5 Volt to 3.3 Volt 
Otherwise you will possibly fry the I/Os pins of the FTDI cable 
If you are not sure about it ask for advice TA Ioannis Smanis

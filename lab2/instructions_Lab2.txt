———————- Putting the Galileo to the Network : Wi-Fi card / Ethernet Port ——

Step 1. Install the wi-fi hardware on the PCI-express socket on the back of the Intel Galileo Gen2 board  (Very gently connect the white and the black antenna-wires on the WiFi card)
Step 2. to connect to the Wi-Fi network see the given guide "Galieo_Wifi_Connection.pdf"
Step 3. when you are done , you can use an SSH client to connect to the Galileo board without the need of the USB-to-Serial cable anymore. (If you are experiencing Galileo password issues connecting your SSH client with the Galileo , use generic linux commands to set a super user password to your board , and try your SSH client again)
step 4. If you are using wi-fi to connect the board to the network , you still can use SSH protocol to connect your computer to the Galileo board (UNIX OS computers can already use ssh command to connect without additional software. For windows users use Putty as an SSH client)
